- 👋 Hi, I’m @MarkPlassmeyer
- 👀 I’m interested in Front End Development, and possibly Full Stack if I like and feel comfortable with Front End.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics: HTML5, CSS, JS.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on...nothing yet, but hopefully that will change soon.
- 📫 How to reach me...I'm not worth reaching out to yet.
